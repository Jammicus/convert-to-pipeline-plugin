        If checked, this will generate a Jenkinsfile and commit it at the root level of the SCM of the initial job.
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> This will checkout the entire repository in a temporary directory on the master at JENKINS_HOME/plugins/convert-to-pipeline/ws.
        <span>
            Add the Jenkinsfile and commit back to the repository. The credentials used would be the ones declared in the initial job's configuration.
        </span>
        <span>
            This temporary directory will be deleted once the operation completes.
        </span>

        The newly created pipeline job will point to the Jenkinsfile committed to the SCM as opposed to inline script.
